# FSM-Based-Clock-Design

## Introduction
This FSM Based Clock works on an UP-DOWN COUNTER where the states are customisable. The clock and further be extended to Years or increased precision to milliseconds. 

## Working
The internal input signal 'leap' is used to identify the year as leap year or not. The variables declared are made self-explanatory for ease of understanding.

## Results
The functionality of the clock has been verified and a waveform is attached below for reference.
The leap day in February has been highlighted with a red circle.
